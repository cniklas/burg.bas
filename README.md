"Die Burg" (The Castle) is a text adventure game à la [Zauberschloß](https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/Zauberschlo%C3%9F) (Magic Castle). I programmed it in 1996 as a 17 year old, after my younger brother had infected me with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

In 2021 I rebuilt the complete game in JavaScript, so that it can now be played in the browser. The structure of the game is still the same as back then; only the texts have been revised and refreshed.
